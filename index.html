<p>Hello! My name is Molly Wilson. Originally from a small town in Delaware, I 
  started attending Bob Jones University for an English Education degree before 
  I changed my major my sophomore year. Now I am a (almost) graduate with a Journalism
  and Mass Communication degree.</p>
<p>In my free time I love gardening, sitting in my hammock, and going to the gym
  with my cousin. However, on days that I am not free, you can find me sitting in a 
  cubicle at my intership, or working on my online classes. After I finish my internship
  and my online classes, I will receive my bachelors degree in August 2019. </p>
