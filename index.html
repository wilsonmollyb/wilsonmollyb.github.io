<h1>Molly Wilson</h1>
  <h2>Bob Jones University Graduate</h2>
  
<p>Hello! My name is Molly Wilson. Originally from a small town in Delaware, I 
  started attending Bob Jones University for an English Education degree before 
  I changed my major my sophomore year. Now I am a (almost) graduate with a Journalism
  and Mass Communication degree. </p>
<p>In my free time I love gardening, sitting in my hammock, and going to the gym
  with my cousin. Unfortunately for my wallet, I love indoor plants a little too much. 
  online sites like <a
                       href="https://www.thesill.com/"> The Sill</a> allow me to buy plants that
  I can decorate with online. Interior deorating is another passion that I recently discovered
  I have. </p>
  <p>However, on days that I am not free, you can find me sitting in a 
  cubicle at my intership, or working on my online classes. After I finish my internship
  and my online classes, I will receive my bachelors degree in August 2019. </p>
  
  <p>Here is my <a

    for more information about me </p>
